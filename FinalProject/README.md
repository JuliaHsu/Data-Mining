# A Study of Sales through Consumer Behavior on Black Friday

CS 584 Data Mining Final Project (May, 9, 2019)<br>I worked with Hung-Mao Chen on this final project.<br>

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday

## Description
The dataset collected the transactions made in the retail store. Each record shows the gender, age, occupation and several features of the customers. We decide to make the association rule analysis based on this dataset and expect to create a recommendation system. The retail store can depend on our results to think about the strategy to stimulate the consumption, for example, the customer who is younger than 17 years old buys a product from the store, then we can recommend another product to him.

## Library
http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/ <br>
The library we used to do the association rule analysis is called mlxtend. The most important parts are creating frequent itemset with Apriori algorithm and generating association rules from frequent itemset. <br>
