--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Through the course projects that I've done in this course, I have learned to implement and evaluate different techniques (models) such as classifiers, clusters, regressions, association rules and anomaly detection. I found that I have a large interest in this field, and I'd like to dig deeper by taking some advanced courses such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
