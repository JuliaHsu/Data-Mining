# K-means,EM, and DBScan

## Project Description

CS 584 Data Mining Project 2- Part 2. (March, 16, 2019)<br>
In this assignment, I implemented different clusters for two datasets and used SSE to determine the value of K. Then, evaluate the results of different clusters via correlation and silhouette coefficient.
